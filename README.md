# Hello, I'm Gopi ‚Äî DevOps Automation Specialist üëã

I specialize in **DevOps automation**, infrastructure-as-code, and deployment pipelines. My work spans shell scripting, Terraform modules, Kubernetes setups, and CI/CD workflows. I package these across two GitHub organizations to illustrate growth across time:

##  GitHub Organizations: Evolution of My Automation Journey

### üöÄ **gopi-tech** (2024 and earlier)
This era includes foundational automation work:

- **roboshop-shell** ‚Äî Service setup automation using shell and `systemd`.
- **k8-*** (e.g., k8-resources, k8-databases, k8-ingress, k8-eksctl, k8-roboshop) ‚Äî Kubernetes deployment scripts and Helm chart essentials.
- **terraform-aws-*** (eks, minikube, security-group, vpc, provisioners, multi-env, etc.) ‚Äî Terraform modules for AWS infra provisioning.
- **roboshop-ansible** & **roboshop-ansible-roles-tf** ‚Äî Ansible-based infra automation.
- **helm-charts**, **dockerfiles**, **roboshop-docker** ‚Äî Containerization and Helm deployment tooling.

###  **gopi-tools** (2025 onward)
This era reflects refined and modular infrastructure and CI/CD tooling. *(Please feel free to list specific repositories if they differ in approach or tech.)*

| **IaC & Provisioning** | Terraform (AWS: EKS, VPC, SG), Ansible                         |
| **Containerization & Orchestration** | Docker, Kubernetes, Helm                             |
| **Deployment Automation** | shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.)           |
| **Repositories**    | Microservices (RoboShop), infra tooling, modular provisioning scripts |

##  Why Explore These Repos?

- **`roboshop-*`** repos demonstrate end-to-end service setup with logging, idempotency, and systemd integration.
- **`k8-*`** and **`helm-charts`** offer Kubernetes deployment foundations.
- **`terraform-aws-*`** repos enable reusable IaC modules for AWS (EKS, VPC, minikube, etc.).
- **`ansible`-based repos** reflect configuration management and infra orchestration practices.
- **Container tooling repos** highlight Docker and deployment packaging proficiency.

##  What's Next

- Consolidating Terraform, shell, and Helm modules into modular libraries.
- Adding sample CI/CD workflows across orgs (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Enhancing documentation and examples for smoother onboarding and reuse.
