## ðŸ’¼ My GitHub Organizations

I maintain two GitHub organizations focused on DevOps and automation scripting, developed over different time periods:

- ðŸš€ [gopi-tech](https://github.com/orgs/Gopi76s) â€” My earlier work (2023â€“2024) featuring foundational automation scripts, provisioning tools, and shell-based infrastructure management.

- ðŸ”§ [gopi-tools](https://github.com/orgs/Gopi76s) â€” A more recent collection (2025 onward), refining previous tools and introducing updated practices in CI/CD and infrastructure as code.

> Together, they reflect my ongoing learning and evolution in DevOps automation across multiple tech stacks.
