# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gopi â€” Site Reliability Engineer | DevOps Automation Specialist

I design and automate **production-ready infrastructure** using Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. My work emphasizes reliability, scalability, and secure automationâ€”optimized for real-world deployment needs.

---

## ðŸ’¼ Current Role: Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

As an SRE, I build tools and modules that make infrastructure deployment faster, safer, and repeatableâ€”focused on reliability across development and production environments.

---

## ðŸ”§ Flagship Project: `roboshop-infra-prod`

A complete, production-ready infrastructure repository using **Terraform + Jenkins**, deployed on **AWS** and structured for microservices.

###  Key Features

- Modular provisioning with Terraform:
  - VPC, Subnets, Route Tables
  - Security Groups & VPN
  - RDS Databases
  - App & Web Load Balancers
  - TLS via ACM
  - CDN (CloudFront)
  - Microservices: User, Cart, Catalogue, Shipping, Payment
- CI/CD Pipelines:
  - `Jenkinsfile` â€“ Infrastructure provisioning
  - `Jenkinsfile-destroy` â€“ Clean teardown pipeline
