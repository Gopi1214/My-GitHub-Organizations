# 👋 Hi, I'm Gopi — Site Reliability Engineer | DevOps Automation Specialist

I design and automate **production-ready infrastructure** using Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. My work emphasizes reliability, scalability, and secure automation — all with a focus on real-world deployment needs.

---

## 💼 Current Role: Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

In my current role, I lead the automation of cloud infrastructure, service delivery, and environment reliability. I build tools and modules that make deployment faster, safer, and repeatable — especially across staging and production environments.

---

## 🔧 Flagship Project: `roboshop-infra-prod`

> A complete production-ready infrastructure project using **Terraform + Jenkins**, deployed on **AWS** and structured with microservices.

### ⚙️ What It Automates

- VPC, Subnets, Route Tables
- Security Groups & VPN
- Databases (RDS)
- Application & Web Load Balancers
- TLS Certificates (ACM)
- CDN with CloudFront
- Multi-service app deployment (User, Cart, Catalogue, Payment, Shipping)
- CI/CD with `Jenkinsfile` for provisioning + teardown
